3l34n0r
=======

3l34n0r (Eleanor) is a bot that I'm currently working on and is part of my IB
Computer Science IA. This bot is *designed* to be accessed via Telegram but 
you can pretty much port it to anything. If you some how felt like running it, 
(Although I don't know why anyone would want to do that), modify the Telegram 
token in 3l34n0r/server.py and then run the server script.

See the LICENSE file of this repository. I decided to license it under GPL3
because it seems like a good choice.
